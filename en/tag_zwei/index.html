                We will have lectures on current political implications, judicial obstacles and data lessons learned. Workshops will focus on election and public transport data, Wikidata, uncovering money flows and a design consulting crash course, as well as a window of opportunity to tackle any issues you can think of in our Barcamps. <br><br>

                         The OK Lab Stuttgart with their citizen science project luftdaten.info is dedicated to measuring fine dust and will install self-made sensors on the back of the building. The sensor generates data for luftdaten.info and produces an automatized map for the entire region. This way fine dust can be made visible. Everyone can participate and <strong><a class="text__red" href="/en/speaker/jan">Jan Lutz</a></strong> will show you how. We want to have as many sensors as possible in Germany and all over the World.

                        How is data actually created? How does a physical event translate into an electronic number? And how can we use this to discover our environment? These are the questions that <strong><a class="text__red" href="/en/speaker/max">Maximilian Voigt</a></strong> will tackle together with you, while also building a measurement station detecting the “work atmosphere”. This will be achieved using a microcontroller with sensors and should enable you to collect data yourself after the workshop.
